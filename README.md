DEATILS OF PROJECT-

Project Stack Overflow Survey (Matplotlib and Seaborn)
Instructions -



Project work should be your own work, so any duplicacy in code/files will not be taken for evaluation
As part of this project the numbering of Question is very important. So while answering any question mention the Q. No.
All the coding questions needs to be done in single Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.
For answering any Descriptive Question, use the Markdown cell in Jupyter Notebook
Submit the project in a single zip file containing all your files/folders/data etc




As part of our second project we are going to work on Visualizations. Our task is to analyze the data, clean it, modify it as and when required and represent it in the form of graphs, charts, plots, which are more appealing to users.



For this project we will be exploring data from Developers’ Survey done by stackoverflow.com every year. This data is huge consisting of around 1 lac developers’ world-wide and on multiple factors.



As part of this DataSet there are two files -



survey_results_schema.csv – It contains list of all the columns and their description

survey_results_public.csv – It contains the Survey data corresponding to different columns



Note – As Dataset is very big so use files carefully and as and when required slice and dice the data for easy handling.
